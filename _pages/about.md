I’m Yixuan Hu, an M.Sc. graduate in Robotics, Cognition and Intelligence from the Technical University of Munich. I completed my bachelor’s degree in automotive engineering at Tongji University, Shanghai. My research interests lie in 3D computer vision, multimodal learning and generative models. For my master thesis, under the supervison of [Slobodan Ilic](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/camp/members/senior-affiliates/slobodan-ilic/) and [Dekai Zhu](https://dekai21.github.io/) I developed a diffusion-based model for LiDAR data generation and introduced unified metrics to evaluate geometric and semantic quality of generated LiDAR scenes, enabling controllable LiDAR scene synthesis. This work was accepted to NeurIPS 2025. Besides, in the project ControlEvents, I achiveved controllable event-camera data generation, where I had the opportunity to work under the co-supervision of [Prof. Daniel Cremers](https://cvg.cit.tum.de/members/cremers) and [Prof. Gerard Pons-Moll](https://virtualhumans.mpi-inf.mpg.de/people/pons-moll.html).

[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template!
